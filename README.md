# newton_secant_algorithm

This project was developed during a Master Degree in UFPI (Universidade Federal do Piaui).

Was developed a parallel algorithm as an alternative to the Newton Secant Method.

To parallelize the code was used OpenMP.

The original algorithm is based on the paper below.

Cominetti, R., Mascarenhas, W.F. Silva, P.J. (2014). A Newtonâ€™s method for the continuous quadratic knapsack problem. Mathematical Programming Computation, 6, 151-169.
